# Golivwell Senior Frontend Developer Test

In addition to successfully translating the provided Figma designs into a functional React website using Tailwind CSS, I took several steps to showcase my expertise as a senior frontend developer:

- Atomic Design and Component Architecture: I structured the codebase into reusable components following the Atomic Design methodology, promoting scalability, maintainability, and consistency.

- Code Splitting and Performance Optimization: I implemented code splitting techniques, lazy loaded images, reducing the initial bundle size and improving load times, demonstrating my understanding of performance optimization best practices.

- Comprehensive Unit Testing: I wrote comprehensive unit tests for components (atoms, molecules and organisms) and utility functions using Jest and React Testing Library, ensuring code reliability and maintainability.
